# Cyberwave Edge Core

This Edge component acts as an orchestrator of your Cyberwave edge components.

## Quickstart (Linux machines)

```bash
# ssh into your edge device then
sudo apt-get install cyberwave-cli

sudo cyberwave install core
```

The cyberwave-cli will ask you to log in with your Cyberwave credentials and then will proceed installing the `cyberwave-edge-core` on your edge device.
